###Stochastic integrals###
__Definition 4.1__ _A stochastic process W is called a Wiener process if the following conditions hold._  

1. W(0) = 0.
2. The process W has independent increments, i.e. if $r < s \le t < u$ then $W(u) - W(t)$ and $W(s) - W(r)$ are independent stochastic variables.    
3. For $s < t$ the stochastic variable $W(t) - W(s)$ has the Gaussian distribution $N[0, \sqrt{t-s}]$.  
4. W has continuous trajectories.  

Information  

__Definition 4.2__ _The symbol $F^X_t$ denotes "the information generated by X on the interval [0,t]", or alternatively "what has happened to X over the interval [0,t]". If, based upon observations of the trajectory $\{ X(n); 0 \le s \le t \}$, it is posible to decide whether a given gevent A has occured or not, then we write this as_  

$$
A \in F^X_t,
$$

or say that "A is $F^X_t$ -measureable"  

__Definition 4.3__   

_We say that the process g belongs to the class $L^2[a,b]$ if the following conditions are satisfied._
